Hi, there! My name is Nick. I'm from the North Side of Chicago and I've lived here pretty much all of my life.

I spent about nine years in the accounting industry, with 6 years at one of the 'Big-4' accounting firms. After a while I decided I needed to make a change, so here I am!

I've been teaching myself how to develop software for a little over a year. I started on my journey with the fantastic Udactiy [Intro to Computer Science](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101/), and haven't looked back since! I love working on both sides of the stack (my first love will always be Python), but I primarily concentrate on front-end development. I enjoy working with React and CSS (SASS/SCSS).

I'm a huge cinephile, so if I'm not writing code I'm probably watching a movie. I have a soft spot for horror movies (despite the fact that I'm very squeamish), sci-fi, and all types of cult cinema. One of my favorite places in the universe is the Music Box Theatre. I also dabble in music production and video games.  
        
Thanks for visiting!
