Hi, there! My name is Nick. I live in Chicago with my wonderful wife. I'm a software developer who primarily works with Ruby on Rails. 

I'm a huge cinephile, so if I'm not writing code I'm probably watching a movie. I'm a lover of horror movies (despite the fact that I'm very squeamish!), sci-fi, and all types of cult cinema. One of my favorite places in the universe is the [Music Box Theatre](https://musicboxtheatre.com/). I also dabble in music production and love video games.  
        
Thanks for visiting!
